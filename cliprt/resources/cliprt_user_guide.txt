CLIPRT - Client Information Parsing and Reporting Tool.

1. Create a Excel compatible workbook and add one or more content worksheets of
    client data that you would like to merge for your marketing efforts.

2. Use CLIPRT to create a Data Element Dictionary (DED) for you.  The DEED is
    constructed by reading through the content worksheets and creating a new
    worksheet that provides a unique list of client data elements.  You will use
    this list to configure your report(s).

3. Use a spreadsheet app to edit the workbook and configure your reports.
    - Element column:
        The data element name.  Don't edit this column.

    - Dest WS column:
        Enter one or more 2 to 3-character destination report indicators.
        Example: "fb, ig" for FaceBook and Instagram marketing efforts.

    - Dest Element column
        If the content data is to map to a different element in the DED, name
        the element.
        Example: for the "cell phone" element map it to "phone" on the report.

    - Dest Format column, this column has multiple purposes:
        a. Specify how to format the data in the report using one of the
            following: (date, name, phone) for more consistent report results.
            Example: "name" - last, first names are reported as first last.
            Example: "date" - dates are reported as mm/dd/yyyy

        b. Specify "indentifier" for elements that help to uniquely identify a
            client.  This is crucial for merging client records.  You should
            have at least 3 of these.
            Example: "name,identifier" 
            Hint: name, email address, and phone number are good identifiers.

        c. Specify "fragment" for elements that need to be combined with 
            others.  First example, first name and last name may need to be
            combined on the report as fullname.  

4. Use CLIPRT to interpret your instructions and to create the marketing
    reports.

5. Use a spreadsheet app to review the report worksheet(s) to use as your
    marketing reports.
